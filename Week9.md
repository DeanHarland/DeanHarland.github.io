### Week 9
This week was tough as I was very uncertain what I was going to do for my 3rd AI project. My lecturer suggested some form of wave function collapse (WFC) pcg algorithm, however at first glance into it I thought it was too complex for me. With the handin weeks away and still incomplete ai projects I had to make a choice what to do. I managed to find a WFC unity tutorial which was a life savour. Working in unity was a big change from ue4 and keeping up with the tutorial was hard, however after a few videos I was starting to understand C# and unity a lot more.  
This leads me to the thought of only using unreal engine 4 for the past few years, and that I should practice more on other engines and languages. Thanks to the university we have access to programming tutorials websites such as sadnasodn which I can sign up to a course and do it every few days in the evening. This would also allow me to see my progress and set goals accordingly.
