### Week 7
This week was mainly finishing up on my prototype ready for the presentation. I tried to make sure that the level had enough visual niceness to show that it is fit for the intended aesthetic experience.
Because I worked alone instead of in a group I would have to present alone. Although I had presented to my class for the 3 years of undergrad, it was only in front of 7 other people, so this was a big increase.
During the presentation I pretty much skipped through the slides so I could just show the video of my prototype and then go sit back down. Even though this presentation was not graded, I felt I performed poorly and that I should enact steps to improve on my presentation skills.
The main area I'd like to improve is the content of the presentation, even though being anxious while presenting negatively affected me that will improve the more I present in front of others.
For the first problem of the content of the presentation, skillsyouneed.com has a few aspects that need to be considered when preparing a presentation. These will affect what you say and how you say it[1].
These key points are: The objective, The subject, The audience, The place and The time.
Setting a clear objective for the presentation will help filter what I put into that presentation because I can ask myself if what iâ€™m saying is going to help achieve the objective. The subject is linked to the objective but are not exactly the same thing. However, because of the type of work I'm doing it will generally be the assignment briefs question.The audience and the place also can be a key factor in planning a presentation however again because it is mainly university work I can assume that the audience will be knowledgeable in the field of what I am presenting. The time of day can also affect how the audience reacts to your presentation, such as in the morning people are generally more alert but getting towards lunchtime people can start to feel hungry and lose concentration.
This method is not as detailed as other ways, however this is a great generalized presentation preset for identifying the way to move forwards in planning out a project.

Maybe add another method and compare the two
