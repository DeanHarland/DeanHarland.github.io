### Week 5
I decided to start the 3 week prototyping task from 701. We had to form groups and decide on a single quote from many for inspiration and then an aesthetic experience we wanted to convey. Because I missed the workshop because of illness I had no group and my friends already got into groups so they could start working on it. This was okay though as I just opened up unreal and instantly thought of a good prototype idea and started it. I really enjoyed doing this as I rarely had to google how to do something and it was just me figuring out how to get things to work even if it was a makeshift way. In our 702 lecture we discussed comfort zone and learning happens when youâ€™re outside the comfort zone. The Past few weeks I've constantly been outside my comfort zone because of how challenging AI is so this was a nice change of pace which helped me reassure that not everything is just too hard to get right. The learning zone model explains this quite well through the 3 different zones[1]. The comfort zone, the learning zone and the panic zone. In essence comfort zone is a place that is familiar to you and you can return to to reflect and make sense of things. The learning zone is just outside comfort zone, the unknown which forces to to learn. The panic zone is where learning is impossible because it is blocked by a sense of fear, expending energy for managing our anxiety with none left for learning.
With this in mind I should reflect on my own feelings before working, when a new assignment is given. Review what will be needed at the end and find work that is not drastically  hard but will eventually build up the skills to be able to move closer to that panic zone. This can include building a good foundation of knowledge regarding the assignment/project or spending a few hours a week building programming skills which translate into the majority of my work.
