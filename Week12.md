### Week 12
This was the final week to work on my AI projects before the hand in. Luckily in the previous week I had put a lot of time into getting my wave function collapse to a working state so that I had my 3 projects to hand in. This meant that I had the whole week to comment and work on my written work for the AI.
Although this was a good thing, having to go back and comment things I did weeks ago made it harder than it should have been. It meant having to re-research things that I had already done, this also made it harder to motivate myself to complete it quickly and to a higher standard.
Next term I will be working with other people so commenting will be a key factor in communicating with them in engine. There are a few programming commenting conventions on the internet, however it is mainly being proactive in the actual commenting that is key. During next terms team module I will be aiming to spend 20 minutes commenting at the end of the day to make sure that the current feature being implemented is clear and consise for any non programming members. This is an important skill to work on because in the industry you might have the chance to work on projects with upwards of 20 people.

As 701 is due for january I plan on doing the bulk of it over christmas, however I would like to improve on my proof reading ability. Over my 3 years of undergraudate I found my essays could have been improved if I only spent that extra bit of time proof reading and making simple changes. This is something to remember for the future.
