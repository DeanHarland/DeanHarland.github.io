### Week 12
This was the final week to work on my AI projects before the hand in. Luckily in the previous week I had put a lot of time into getting my wave function collapse to a working state so that I had 3 projects to hand in. This meant that I had the whole week to comment and work on my written work for the AI.
Although this was a good thing, having to go back and comment things you did weeks ago made it harder than it should have been. It meant having to re-research things that I had already done, this also made it harder to motivate myself to complete it quickly and to a higher standard.
Next term I will be working with other people so commenting will be a key factor in communicating with them in engine. By simply being more proactive in commenting would help significantly however making a set time each week to make sure comments are accetable along with other written work.
