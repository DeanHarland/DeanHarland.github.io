### Week 1
During week 1 we had our induction lectures, which consisted mainly of explaining the modules structure. 
Comp 702 portfolio of AI instances had an introductory explanation of artificial intelligence and its application to games. Comp 701 personal case study had an introductory explanation on agile development and how it is used in the games industry. 
In relation to comp 701 the discussion of agile helped to underpin its importance as well as comparing and contrasting to different industry standard methodologies. It is important to look at these practices when working in teams on the upcoming prototyping projects, because this approach to learning can help me improve my own practices. Planning ahead, we will be doing week long prototyping phases so adopting the appropriate development methodology would greatly improve mine an my teams productivity.
