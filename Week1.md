### Week 1
In our induction week, we were given a 12 page report on parameterizing behaviour trees to read and write notes for the next session. I found that my notes were lacking when we had to discuss the topics at hand. My notes consisted mainly of what I found interesting, instead I should have structured my notes to be more analytical and have a better structure. The mapping method is a good way of breaking down the information and helps shows the relations between each discussed point [1]. This would also allow me to write notes around these points to further analyze them.  Although this method could be used in lectures, the Cornell method would be more beneficial as it helps to reflect on the notes by summarizing them in my own words [2].

I started my first artificial intelligence component this week. Getting back into unreal engine was quite nice as there were small things that I remembered that sped up navigating the engine. However I had a problem with the zombie AI chasing the human AI, which had me stuck for 2 days. In the zombie AI I was unable to get the location of the human AI when the zombie sees it. After a lot of trial and error and searching online I was having no luck, I then decided to sift through comments on UE 4 AI perceptions youtube videos. I saw a comment about using an array to get a reference to the location. Following this lead, I was able to find a way to use an array to find the closest human ai to the zombie. I found that I was just typing in what I wanted into google and just searching each page, hoping to find something. Spending some time researching the different resources would greatly benefit my future learning as then I can choose the best resource dependent on the problem.

We started our first prototyping stage for 701. We grabbed quite a few random pieces to give us some ideas for the project. There were 2 main ideas that were on the table, and we ended up going for the 4 player pirate ship at sea one. We took a play test approach to the game, in which we had a rough idea and just jumped into the game, as we played we discussed and wrote down problems we were finding as we went along. We also had one of our teammates not play, and simply observe. At the end of the game we discussed and planned out how we would resolve them. For the type of game we were creating, I think that the playtest method is quite efficient at iterating the game[3].
