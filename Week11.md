### Week 11
This week was focused mainly on getting 702 wave function collapse to a point of passing. Also during a peer review I was informed of a few things that I needed to do to my other 2 AI pieces to get a pass. Figuring out what to work on each day became quite overwhelming as I had so many different little tasks that it was hard to keep track of.
I started to create a list on a piece of paper that I could put on the wall behind my screen. This list consisted of my 3 AI components and were split into their own groups with the tasks under them that I needed to complete. At the end of each day I would review the completed tasks and create a new task checklist. Over the week I made a few changes to the checklist such as adding checkboxes with smiley faces in to increase the reward of finishing a task. I started to use numbers to prioritize certain task, this also helped keep me focused when I was not sure what to work on. Although there are online software that I could also use for this. The act of spending 5-10 minutes to create a physical copy feels more rewarding and helps to reaffirm the plan in my head.
