### Week 3
At the start of the week I put a considerable more amount of hours into my 702 behaviour tree assignment as the previous fix to the zombie AI bug wasn't a good enough.
After the lecture for the 701 prototyping project, our team had a problem in communication where we did not have a plan or anyway to contact each other, other than through word of mouth of friends. As I do not use social media this makes things a little more difficult. However Discord is a good idea for these short group projects[1]. As almost everyone uses discord and it can easily be accessed from the internet without having to download the software. It would be easy to invite people to a server and then delete the server afterwards. You can have different sections for announcements, working on and so on. It is also more casual for these types of projects which helps keep up communication between teammates.

A more professional communication tool is Slack[2]. This is a great tool that we also use at university yet it is also meant for long term use and not for these short projects. I will most likely push slack onto my team members in second term as I know it works well and can be set up on your phone with notifications. Another tool is monday.com which is more focused on simple structures that help clarify the sequence of work that needs to be done[3]. This is a great visual aid to help team members see what needs to be done and how well other people are progressing. I would like to try this in a group for myself as it would be a great weekly thing to review as a team.
Next group project I will be making sure to get a means of group communication before everyone leaves the workshop. Iâ€™ve also heard that this was a problem in other groups so this goes to show how easy it is to lose track of work ethic.
