### Week 4
Planning
While working on my 702 AI component I found myself mindlessly working on it each day, deciding at the start of each day what I would work on. Although this can be quite good allowing me to have more flexibility on what I work on each day, it was hard to see the bigger picture. With normal assignments this would normally work quite well, however because we have 3 weeks per component, planning would better my time management and workflow.

Dependent on what the assignment entails and how knowledgeable I am the work I am doing, I could use the waterfall method[1]. This methodology places greater emphasis on documentation like requirements and design docs so before I start working, I will be able to fully see what I need to do and to what quality. The waterfall method also allows me time to properly research what I will be working on, instead of always having to do it on the day of working on it. However that is also a problem with the methodology as you cannot plan for unexpected problems during development. Hopefully with the size of said components, this should not be as much a problem as if it were a game sized project.
Although I could use the popular agile methodology[2], which allows for consistent iterations of a project. Using the waterfall method for these smaller pieces will keep me focused and on track for 3 weeks. With this in mind during week 5 I will be starting a new AI piece which I will be adopting the waterfall to assess how well it works.
