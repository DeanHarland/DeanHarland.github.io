### Week 10
This term I have almost only worked from home on my projects, this meant my personal computer has filled up with a lot of varied folders and files from work and home. This includes my internet browser bookmarks and desk work space.
This “messy workplace” over time has made it an unorganised way to work. Adding extra time to tasks just to find things or to set up resources and projects ready for work.


Google chrome has an account feature that allows its user to easily switch between different accounts. What this means is that I would be able to create a chrome account specifically for learning/work, so that when signed in, all resources can be organised into correct bookmark folders. It also negates the chance of being distracted by other websites that would normally be a click away.

In the past I have had a folder in my documents called university, and I would shove all my files into it that were to do with university. However I would sometimes put game projects in the engines folders to keep them seperate, this happened with other items and it started to create a problem. Creating 2 main folders called work and home, I would be able to move all learning/university/game engines into the work folder. This would greatly clean up and help for future organisation as clutter shouldn't cross between them.

These simple tasks of cleaning up messy workplaces has been proven to have benefits to productivity and happiness.
