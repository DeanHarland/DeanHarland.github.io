### Week 8
During our 702 lecture we all realised that our deadline for our work was not january but december 13th instead. This meant that everyone's plan to really polish everything off during that month was foiled. This meant I really had to be finishing up my authoring behaviour before week 9 where we will be starting our 3rd AI component. A big issue I faced was the lack of assets I had to get my components looking more like a game and less like a template for ue4. I knew I couldnâ€™t ask other people for help as its not feasible for them to create extra work for themselves, so I went to google to find some free ones. Assets, not people. However I found I hadn't actually had the need to find more complex assets, this led to it being difficult to find a good website with free content. All though not needed in my work currently other assets such as sounds, and animation will eventually be needed so finding the right resources these things will be greatly beneficial. 

Assest resources
