### Week 6
During this week I worked mainly on my 702 A* path finding project. The tutorial I’m following was originally made by a french speaker and then converted into a fast version which is sped up without audio. This was one of the only tutorials I could find that worked partly towards what I wanted out of the piece of work. Because It had no audio I had to put a lot more effort into understanding what and why he was doing in the videos. And although I understood most of it, there were some parts I did not, I also found I worked considerably slower without anyone explaining it.

During the tutorial I found that I was learning new things about the unreal engine that I’d never seen/ learned before. I saw this as a positive as well as a negative, as it was great I was learning these new techniques and practices however it showed that I’ve been spending too much time focused on the assignments, and I have been neglecting other skills that need to be improved upon. General in engine skills and outside programming skills are the 2 main areas I want to work on.
